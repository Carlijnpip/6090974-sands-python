# Systems and signals python project

For this project I created a code which contains functions which generate signals and code which performs operations on signals and plots them. First the libraries Numpy and Matplotlib needed to be added to the project. Numpy in orderto be able to work numerically and create arrays and matplotlib to plot the signals. There are two python documents. One with the functions to generate the signals and the operations and one which calls on the signals, plots it and saves it. Two signals are plotted, as sinusoidal and a unit step function. The operations done are time-shifting and time-scaling.
