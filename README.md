In this project I want to create a mealplan which caters to the needs of the user, specifically the needed amount of calories. 
I will need Pandas to analyze the data and Numpy for calculations. First I gather the user's information, for example their weight, length, 
how often they workout, etc. Then using this data I calculate the maintenance calories, so what the user needs to stay at their current weight. 
Then I ask them about their goal and using this the program will create a meal plan, using a dataset containing many different meals and their dietary dimensions.
